        <!-- FIRST WEBSITE  -->

        <span class="item">
            <span class="item-tittle"><h2>PARC: Contrast</h2></span>
            <span class="item-content">

                <p>HARINA YA!</p>
                <p><a href="https://yayaya.com.ec/">https://yayaya.com.ec/</a></p>

                <p>
                    In this example we can see how the product's website contrasts between two colors, a strong and dominant one such as red, in relation to the white that is in the background. Well alternated handling of red/white tones for the different sections, buttons, titles and texts.</p>

        <!-- SECOND WEBSITE  -->

        <span class="item">
            <span class="item-tittle"><h2>FITT'S LAW</h2></span>
            <span class="item-content">

                <p>VERY GOOD COPY</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.verygoodcopy.com">https://www.verygoodcopy.com</a></p>
                <p><center><img src="img/w2.jpg"></center></p>
                <p>The "very good copy" website shows us in simple terms, the purpose of what we will learn, framed in a strikingly large title. Additionally, and this is where Fitt's law applies, the button to subscribe and access the service is remarkably visible, centered and with a color that attracts attention. It took 1 second for my eyes to go from the title, to the subscribe button.</p>

        <!-- THIRD WEBSITE  -->

        <span class="item">
            <span class="item-tittle"><h2>HICK'S LAW</h2></span>
            <span class="item-content">

                <p>NIKE STORE</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.nike.com/">https://www.nike.com/</a></p>
                <p><center><img src="img/w3.jpg"></center></p>
                <p>The NIKE store website allowed me to visually demonstrate the entire concept framed in Hick's law. Being a web user, coming to the site for a specific need (children's sports shoes), I was able to quickly notice the different categories. Allowing me to get where I wanted in just 2 seconds. Lots of user intuition on this site. Most web catalogs are based on using categories to facilitate the search of products by Internet users.</p>
